# ZombieGame
A Game  made in my first year of university. It uses processing, a language based on java, designed to help people learn programming.

The assignment was to make a point and click game. I made a game where you shot zombies as they approch your base.

To run this, first download processing from here: https://processing.org/. Then you should be able to open up the program by opening up ZombieGame.p
